# Autonomous Claude + Codex Development

A reusable Claude Code plugin for bounded autonomous feature development:

```text
feature idea
  -> Codex idea enhancement
  -> Codex implementation plan
  -> Claude reconciliation and implementation
  -> project verification
  -> independent Codex review
  -> Claude finding triage and fixes
  -> re-verification and re-review
```

The main entry point is:

```text
/autonomous-development:autonomous-feature "Add resumable file uploads"
```

The plugin deliberately keeps Claude as the implementation orchestrator and uses fresh, read-only Codex executions for independent planning and review. It does not push, merge, deploy, rotate credentials, alter remote infrastructure, or apply irreversible production migrations.

## Included skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/autonomous-development:autonomous-feature` | Run the complete workflow from a high-level idea |
| `/autonomous-development:enhance-idea` | Ask Codex to turn a rough feature idea into a structured proposal |
| `/autonomous-development:implementation-plan` | Ask a fresh Codex execution for a repository-grounded plan |
| `/autonomous-development:implement-plan` | Implement the accepted plan with Claude |
| `/autonomous-development:verify-feature` | Discover and run relevant repository checks |
| `/autonomous-development:codex-review` | Run an independent structured Codex review |
| `/autonomous-development:adversarial-review` | Challenge high-risk architecture and operational assumptions |
| `/autonomous-development:fix-findings` | Triage and fix validated review findings |
| `/autonomous-development:autonomous-status` | Show workflow state and remaining gates |

## Requirements

- Claude Code with plugin and skill support.
- Python 3.11 or later.
- Git.
- Codex CLI installed and authenticated.
- A Git repository for the target project.

Install Codex CLI when needed:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
codex login
```

The official OpenAI Codex plugin for Claude Code is optional for this project because the workflow invokes `codex exec` directly to obtain schema-validated output. It remains useful for manual `/codex:*` commands:

```text
/plugin marketplace add openai/codex-plugin-cc
/plugin install codex@openai-codex
/reload-plugins
/codex:setup
```

## Run locally

From the parent directory of this plugin:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./claude-codex-autonomous-development
```

Then open a target repository and invoke:

```text
/autonomous-development:autonomous-feature "Add audit-log export as JSON and CSV"
```

For development validation:

```bash
make check
claude plugin validate . --strict
```

## State and generated artifacts

Each target repository receives a local run directory:

```text
.ai/autonomous-development/
├── run-state.json
├── feature-request.md
├── repository-context.txt
├── feature-spec.codex.json
├── accepted-spec.md
├── implementation-plan.codex.json
├── accepted-plan.md
├── review-01.codex.json
├── adversarial-01.codex.json
└── verification/
```

Add `.ai/` to the target repository's `.gitignore` unless the generated planning evidence should be committed.

## Completion rules

A run succeeds only when:

- an accepted specification and accepted plan exist;
- all recorded verification commands pass;
- the latest Codex review returns `pass`;
- no unresolved `critical` or `high` findings remain;
- an adversarial review passes when the change is classified as high risk.

A run stops as `blocked` when credentials or required services are unavailable, requirements materially conflict, verification cannot be performed, or the maximum review/fix rounds are exhausted.

## Security boundaries

The skill uses Codex with `--sandbox read-only`. Claude performs repository edits under Claude Code's normal permission system. The workflow explicitly prohibits:

- `danger-full-access`, `--yolo`, or bypassing sandbox controls;
- pushing, merging, publishing, or deploying;
- modifying production data or remote infrastructure;
- rotating or exposing credentials;
- deleting unrelated user changes;
- weakening tests or security controls to obtain a passing result.

Run autonomous development in a disposable branch or worktree. The orchestrator asks Claude Code to use an isolated worktree whenever supported.

## Customization

- Edit `prompts/*.md` to tailor Codex's planning and review behavior.
- Edit `schemas/*.schema.json` to add organization-specific output requirements.
- Extend `skills/verify-feature/references/check-discovery.md` with project-specific commands.
- Change `max_review_rounds` through the controller's `init --max-review-rounds` option.

## Compatibility note

Claude Code and Codex evolve quickly. The project uses documented plugin-root component layout, `SKILL.md` frontmatter, skill-scoped hooks, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, and `codex exec --output-schema`. Run `make check` and `claude plugin validate . --strict` after upgrading either CLI.
